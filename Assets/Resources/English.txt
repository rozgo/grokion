{avatarSpirit}collect orbs to replenish...

{avatarSpirit}should be collected whenever possible...

[Hotspot|BO|4]
{avatarSpirit|SpiritAlert}Be resourceful, LDU-1.
{avatarSpirit}boxes can be pushed to open obstructed paths-
{avatarSpirit}and may open access to new areas.

{avatarSpirit}and the most evolved and elite of the species -
{avatarSpirit|}all sure to meet their end if the Biosphere
{avatarSpirit}isn't  stabilized before they arrive.

[Hotspot|CO1|2]
{avatarDoctor}LDU-1, is that you??
{avatarDoctor}How can this be?
{avatarDoctor}All lunar defence units have perished.
{avatarDoctor}It is me, your creator...
{avatarDoctor}Doctor Savain.
{avatarDoctor}LDU-1, We need to save the Biosphere!
{avatarDoctor}It has somehow turned against itself.
{avatarDoctor}a virus now contaminates the system.
{avatarDoctor}Where did it all go wrong...? 
{avatarDoctor}you must get to my laboratory at once!
{avatarDoctor}when the chaos erupted, I locked myself in.
{avatarDoctor}You are the only one who can free me now.
{avatarDoctor}quickly, go to the civil elevator!
{avatarDoctor}it is on the far side of this floor.
{avatarDoctor}But beware of the high security bot...
{avatarDoctor}It roams the area beyond this room.
{avatarDoctor}it will likely view you as a threat.
{avatarDoctor}Good luck, LDU-1!
(A new Objective has been added!)

[Hotspot|CO2|2]
{avatarDoctor}LDU-1, you have returned!
{avatarDoctor}There is so much you need to know...
{avatarDoctor}But this is not time or place!
{avatarDoctor}With the civil elevator destroyed,
{avatarDoctor}we have only one choice...
{avatarDoctor}You must traverse the inner chambers.
{avatarDoctor}into the core of the Biosphere.
{avatarDoctor}I see you've equipped a surge blaster...
{avatarDoctor}you can use it to power the orange portals.
{avatarDoctor}Below this level is an alternate route.
{avatarDoctor}I have uploaded the location into your cpu.
{avatarDoctor}I believe we-

{avatarSpirit|SpiritAlert}Confirmation isn’t possible, LDU-1 - 
{avatarSpirit}we must quicken pace and locate 
{avatarSpirit}Dr. Savain to lend aid!

[Hotspot|C03|1]
{avatarDoctor}LDU-1, you made it!
{avatarDoctor}as soon as I saw that beast, I...
{avatarDoctor}Thanks to you, hope clings to the Biosphere.
{avatarDoctor}But I fear your greatest challenge awaits.
{avatarDoctor}Beyond this chamber lies the Vivarium experiment.
{avatarDoctor}It is- "was" a place of great beauty.
{avatarDoctor}The virus... it has twisted all life within it.
{avatarDoctor}But I know you will prevail.
{avatarDoctor}You were the first, and are now the last.
{avatarDoctor}You have made me proud, LDU-1.
{avatarDoctor}Go now... and defend the Biosphere!

[Hotspot|FN|Lava]

[Hotspot|MO|2]
{avatarspirit}There is nothing more for us here, LDU-1.
{avatarSpirit}Let us return to the level above.

[Hotspot|HK|Water]  
{avatarSpirit}These waterways can be crossed by walking through
{avatarSpirit}or wading atop, but a hydrosuit is needed to 
{avatarSpirit}venture below surface...

[Hotspot|IM|1]
{avatarSpirit}These grounds contain earthen elements much needed
{avatarSpirit}to foster and sustain human life...

[Fallen|JJ|1]
(Hydrosuit acquired)
{avatarSpirit|SpiritAlert}You can submerge fully and explore
{avatarSpirit}underwater when clad in this
{avatarSpirit}Hydrosuit, LDU-1...

[Vignette|GM|1]

{avatarSpirit}I sense you perceive this beauty...
{avatarSpirit}perhaps The spark of life has touched you.
{avatarSpirit}are you something more than parts and commands?
{avatarSpirit}That, we shall see...
{avatarSpirit}This place is unknown to me, LDU-1.
{avatarSpirit}I must survey the path ahead.
